## Project Overview
**BeautyBot: AI for Beauty Product Launch Optimization
Project Overview
Problem Area
This project addresses the challenge of helping beauty brands optimize new product launches and pricing strategies by using data-driven insights. Key issues include:
Predicting product success and customer satisfaction based on early data
Identifying optimal pricing strategies for new products
Understanding diverse customer preferences to minimize product mismatches
Reducing the risks and costs associated with product trial-and-error for consumers
Affected Stakeholders
Beauty brands and retailers
Product development and marketing teams
Pricing strategists
Consumers (secondary impact)
Proposed Data Science Solution
We aim to develop and evaluate machine learning models to drive insights for beauty brands:
Numerical Prediction (e.g., predicting optimal price ranges)
Customer Grouping (e.g., clustering customers into beauty personas)
Product Recommendation Models (e.g., suggesting products based on user preferences)
Categorical Prediction (e.g., predicting customer satisfaction)
These models will:
Predict fair price ranges for new products
Help define customer personas based on purchase habits
Optimize marketing and product launch strategies
Minimize product mismatch risks for target customer groups
Impact
The potential impact of BeautyBot includes:
Increased revenue through better-targeted launches (estimates suggest >$100,000 revenue uplift per product)
Higher customer loyalty and reduced return rates
Significant time and money savings for both companies and customers
Enhanced competitive advantage through data-driven product strategy
Dataset Description
Our initial analysis utilizes a dataset sourced from Sephoraâ€™s website (over 9,000+ products, including):
Product ratings
Customer reviews
Price points
Ingredient lists
Data Dictionary

Variable
Description
Type
product_id
Unique identifier for each product
String
product_name
Name of the product
String
price
Current price in USD
Float
rating
Average customer rating (out of 5)
Float
review_count
Number of customer reviews
Integer
ingredients
List of ingredients used in the product
String
category
Beauty category (e.g. skincare, makeup)
String

Methodology
Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, text parsing for ingredients)
Feature engineering (e.g., creating categories based on price ranges, ingredient features)
Implementation of ML models (Numerical prediction, clustering, recommendations)
Evaluation using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), silhouette score for clustering, and classification accuracy
Visualization of results (e.g., product launch risk matrix, customer persona clusters)
Results
The project will generate:
Price optimization models for new products
Customer segmentation charts
Recommendation engines to guide marketing and launch strategies
Predictive insights into product success based on early performance indicators
Limitations
Dataset age: Sephora data is ~5 years old; updated datasets may be needed for live application.
Bias: Skew toward brands and demographics popular on Sephora; generalization to other retailers may require broader datasets.
Ingredient Complexity: Parsing and modeling ingredient effects may require further natural language processing (NLP).
Future Work
Update datasets to include more recent beauty products and reviews
Incorporate social media sentiment analysis (e.g., TikTok, Instagram trends)
Explore computer vision models analyzing product packaging or before/after images
Integrate larger customer profile datasets to refine personas
Expand to recommend launch strategies based on emerging beauty trends
